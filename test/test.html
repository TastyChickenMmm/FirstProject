<!--Hello, my name is Tom Riddle. I see you have found my source code.-->

<body style="background-color: powderblue; color: darkslategray; font-family: helvetica;">
  <h1 style = "color:red;">HELLO WORLD</h1>
  <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <h3>Hello world</h3>
  <h4>hello world</h4>
  <h5>heywold</h5>
  <h6>hiwo</h6>

    This is some meaningless text. The only purpose this text serves is to
    demonstrate my ability to use text. Therefore, is this text meaningful? No.
  </p>
  <p>
    No? Why not? Only a text with meaning could answer a question like that. How odd.

  <h1 style = "color: black;">Here are some more black pixels</h1>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">Or blue pixels, if you're into that type of thing</a>
  <p>That was a link.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Oh no, you clicked on it! Now the link is purple, and it will never ever be blue again.</p>

  <img src = "someJPEG.png" alt="strange, you should not be seeing this text..." width = "248" />
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>haha. Anyways, one of the following blue texts is a link.</p>
  <p title = "I'm not a link :(" style = "color:blue;" ><u>I'm a link!</u></p>
  <p title = "I'm not a link either" style = "color:blue;" ><u>I'm a link!</u></p>
  <p title = "Are you seriously going top down?" style = "color:blue;" ><u>I'm a link!</u></p>
  <p title = "Don't you think I would've predicted that?" style = "color:blue;" ><u>I'm a link!</u></p>
  <p title = "Obviously the last text would be the real link" style = "color:blue;" ><u>I'm a link!</u></p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" title = "Don't listen to the above text. Obviously it would be the link!">I'm a link!</a>
  <p title = "hehe I'm a liar" style = "color:blue;" ><u>I'm a link!</u></p>

    This haiku uses
    The "pre" element, preserves
    Spaces and line breaks

  <p style = "color: black; background-color: black;"> I see you have deciphered my secret message<p>

    Now I know what you're thinking. <del>This website is pointless</del> This
    online page lacks purpose. But worry not, because I have testimonies! An
    anonymous loyal reader sent this to me the other day:
    <blockquote cite = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">
      This website has proven simply <em>too inspiring</em> to put into words. Not
      only have I discovered that tacocat backwards is tacocat, but even
      <q>RACECAR</q> is a palindrome! This astonishing fact has turned my life
      around a full 360 degrees! I am indebted to you.
    </blockquote> <br />
    Now, if you are still not convinced, take a look at TACO CAT backwards! <br />
  </p>
  <p align = "center"><bdo dir = "rtl">TACO CAT </bdo><br />
    Or, if you really are stubborn, I added every single tag onto it! <br />
    <b><strong><i><em><del><sub><sup><mark><small><ins><bdo dir = "rtl" style = "color: red; background-color: hsla(274, 90%, 75%, 0.9); border: 2px dotted lightgreen;">TACO CAT</bdo></ins></small></mark></sup></sub></del></em></i></strong></b>
