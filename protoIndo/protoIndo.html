  <h1 id = "top">Proto-Indo-European: An Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    For countless centuries, people have been noticing particular similarities
    between seemingly unrelated languages. For example, the words for father, in
    the languages English, Latin, Greek, Spanish, German, respectively, are:
    <i>father, pater, patéras, padre, vater.</i> And there were loads of these kinds
    of parallels between languages, for many words.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a long time these patterns were waved off as simple word-borrowing from languages
    spoken in close proximity. But in the 1500's, new trade routes with India exposed Europeans
    to a new language: Sanskrit, whose word for father was <i>piter</i>. This was shocking, since
    relations with India had not been going on <em>nearly</em> long enough for such word-borrowing. And
    so the idea of Proto-Indo-European was proposed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scholars decided there must be a sort of parent language, which they called Proto-Indo-European or PIE,
    spoken roughly 6,000 years ago. As speakers migrated across the continent,
    their dialects' pronounciations, morphology, and vocabulary would have, over time, slowly diverged into
    most of the languages now spoken between Europe and India.
  </p>
  <p>
    These languages are called <strong>Indo-European</strong> languages, which
    together compose the <strong>Indo-European language family.</strong>

  <!-- NOTE: LINGUISTIC RECONSTRUCTION -->
  <h2 id = "LR">Linguistic Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>No direct evidence exists of Proto-Indo-European, so linguists resort to a
    method known as <i>linguistic reconstruction</i>: comparing the vocabulary
    and historical sound changes of known languages to deduce, or "reconstruct",
    the original PIE language.</p>

  <h3>PIE Vocabulary</h3>
  <p>In this section I show a few of my favorite PIE words, and how they changed evolved in other Indo-European languages
    in each of the major families of descendents. A more complete can be found on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_vocabulary">Wikipedia.</a>
    You will find many weird-looking vowels. The precise sound of each vowel can
    be found <a href="https://academiaprisca.org/indoeuropean/indo-european_word.htm">here.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The oldest well-documented language of each family is given, although modern
    forms are also given for comparison purposes. Languages are followed
    by the symbol <i>c</i>, standing for <i>circa</i>, which is followed by the
    approximate time period in which the language was spoken.
