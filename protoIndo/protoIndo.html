        <p>
          For countless centuries, people have been noticing particular similarities
          between seemingly unrelated languages. For example, the words for father, in
          the languages English, Latin, Greek, Spanish, German, respectively, are:
          <i>father, pater, pat√©ras, padre, vater.</i> And there were loads of these kinds
          of parallels between languages, for many words.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a long time these patterns were waved off as simple word-borrowing from languages
          spoken in close proximity. But in the 1500's, new trade routes with India exposed Europeans
          to a new language: Sanskrit, whose word for father was <i>piter</i>. This was shocking, since
          relations with India had not been going on <em>nearly</em> long enough for such word-borrowing. And
          so the idea of Proto-Indo-European was proposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scholars decided there must be a sort of parent language, which they called Proto-Indo-European or PIE,
          spoken roughly 6,000 years ago. As speakers migrated across the continent,
          their dialects' pronounciations, morphology, and vocabulary would have, over time, slowly diverged into
          most of the languages now spoken between Europe and India.
        </p>
        <p>
          These languages are called <strong>Indo-European</strong> languages, which
          together compose the <strong>Indo-European language family.</strong>

        <!-- NOTE: LINGUISTIC RECONSTRUCTION -->
        <h3 id = "LR">Linguistic Reconstruction</h3>
          <p>No direct evidence exists of Proto-Indo-European, so linguists resort to a
          method known as <i>linguistic reconstruction</i>: comparing the vocabulary
          and historical sound changes of known languages to deduce, or "reconstruct",
          the original PIE language.</p>
          <p>A list of my favorite PIE words can be found on my <a href = "resources.html#pie_words">Resources page</a>.
