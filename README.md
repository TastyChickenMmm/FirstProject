# FirstProject
This is my first test-run with html. Also, ChickenAgent2227 is my personal github account that I use to commit stuff from my computer.

Finished HTML with commit 5bb8c79. The advanced part is layout, which changes based on the width of the screen.

Finished CSS with commit f8811da.

Finished Bootstrap I with commit 0f691f3. 
  Rows/columns: FAQ cards in Contact Me.
  Fancy Navbar: The navbar is sticky.
  List of Cool Things:
    - Cards (Contact Me)
    - Collapsible ("Answer" buttons in Contact Me)
    - Media Objects (Quotes at bottom of Contact Me)
    - Carousel (Scrolls through multiple quotes at bottom of Contact Me)
    - Pagination (I used the pagination class, but it was really just a list of buttons. At bottom of Home.)
